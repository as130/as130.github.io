        My name is Abigail Siegel, but I go by Abby.  I was born and raised in New England and I'm currently a senior studying computer
        science at Brown University with a focus in security.  In my free time I like playing the melodica, piano, playing with my dogs, and doing CTFs.

            The summer after my freshman year of college, I interned at The Home Depot corporate offices in Atlanta, Georgia as a 
            software engineering intern on the payments team where I first got introduced to the world of cyber-security.  From 
            there, I interned at the Microsoft Corporate offices in Redmond, Washington the summer after my sophomore year as a software
            engineering intern on the Microsoft Office Feature Blue security team.  The summer after my Google year, I interned at Google
            in the Sunnyvale, California office (but remote from Providence, Rhode Island!) on the Tech Infra Security and Privacy team 
            as a software engineering intern.

            During my time at Brown, I have really enjoyed TAing multiple courses. My Freshman and Sophomore year I was a TA for ENGN0090 
            (Management of Industrial and Nonprofit Organizations) and ENGN0900 (Managerial Decision Making) and served as the first-ever 
            freshman TA for the courses!  My sophomore fall I was also a TA for CSCI0170 (Computer Science: An Integrated Introduction), and 
            went on to TA CSCI1660 (Introduction to Computer Systems Security) both my junior spring, and now that I am a senior.  I'm also a member of 
            Full Stack at Brown, a club that works on applications for the Brown University community.  There, I helped organize our virtual
            hackathon and the CTF for the hackathon.
        </p>

            I've also been luck to get to work with ICERM over the years and their Girls Get Math summer program.  Back when I was in high school,
            I got to participate in the program where I was first introduced to computer science, and have since then interned for the program once
            and served twice as a TA where I created a new lab in which students would create a naive bayesian classifier in MatLab to filter out Spam
            emails from a set of data.
